## 2023 MDDN342 Assignment 2: Randomised Collections
[Hosted on GitHub pages!](https://23-mddn342.github.io/project-2-randomised-collections-henrybethwaite/)

This project has been very difficult for me; both because of personal circumstances and a lot of difficulty getting my initial idea into fruition. However, I am still quite pleased with the result I was able to create. It has a coherent style and I was proud of the amount of character in both of the faces.
Phoebe and I have had many discussions about how being able to create something that isn’t necessarily what you have in mind or aligns with your taste is an important skill as a designer. It’s projects like these that due to an initial lack of vision have really help me to improve on that skill.
